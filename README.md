This was a display that I made for my Acapella group's Music Director to be able to use my Moto 360 strapped to their hand to direct dynamics while our group did choreo.

We had been having a problem with that for a while in preperation for an audition video.

With the buttons on a webapp displayed on the Moto 360 and a tablet set up front, next to the camera, she would press the buttons to move us from a level of intensity 1 to 4, and there would a number displayed on the tablet in real time using firebase!

Pretty easy but it came in super handy.
